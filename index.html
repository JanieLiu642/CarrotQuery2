        Sorry I mean using tables first in Word and pasting into Outlook. But the tables I created are not responsive as
        Erica’s tables that even change sizes when the Outlook browser changes (the attachment). I do remember you used
        tables in Cognos to make the interface you showed the other day.

        Dynamic resizing makes it look weird when the columns get too narrow.<br/>
        My neighbour put a For Sale sign out in front of his house on Friday. I’ve been watching for it to be posted
        online all weekend. <span class="italic">If you buy it, you could shovel the snow off my driveway every winter. Wouldn’t that be fun?
        I wouldn’t even ask you to pay me for the privilege of cleaning my driveway for me!</span>

        The tables are nice to be responsive, and it is not meant to be resized into narrow columns.<br/>
        I am looking for a stacked condo that hopefully will come up in Cummings and its neighboring areas, close to
        where I live now. Thanks for inviting me to be your neighbor. I am not sure I want to entertain that idea unless
        it is really a good deal.<br/>
        I do not think I deserve the “privilege” though. Stop seeing me as cheap labor! You are not that old and you’ve
        got at least 20 years before you have someone else shovel your snow.

    <div class="column"><span class="highlight">From: Scharf, Jeffrey </span>
        <span class="italic">I am only making helpful suggestions for opportunities that would allow you to get outside and enjoy the fresh
        air while you contribute to my community! You could also cut the grass in the summers for me if you were a good
        neighbour. Plus you can chase away all the squirrels that dig up my vegetable garden. You would be so busy with
        lots of fun projects all year long in my neighbourhood!</span><br/>
        I started to write about convenient features in the north and south parts of Cummings and then wondered why I
        was telling you about the convenient things of an area you’re already familiar with. You probably even know the
        area better than me. I do most of my shopping at Gloucester Centre so I don’t head towards St Laurent Boulevard
        very often.

        I was told you are moving on to a better place (sounds like paradise!) But if you keep showing up in our team
        meeting, I will keep bugging you to review the legacy missions you left. Let me know when it is ‘none of your
        business’!

        “Moving on to a better place” sounds like the delicate way of telling someone I just unexpectedly died. <span class="italic">Jeff was
        too good for this cruel world. He has moved on to the cat café in the sky to spend the rest of eternity playing
        with fluffy kittens that never bite or scratch.</span><br/>
        Thanks for reminding me that your work is none of my business. I had forgotten. Now I have my excuse for why I
        won’t comment on your stuff anymore.
    </div>
    <div class="column"><span class="highlight">From: Scharf, Jeffrey </span>
        <span class="italic">I stick with my advice to you any time you move on to the cat café in the sky. Don’t burn bridges when you go.</span>
        If you are going to go, make sure your manager knows. Be ready to talk to her about why you are leaving. Do
        whatever you’re asked to do while you’re still around to help out with any transition. Make sure the only
        negative thing people say when you leave is that they wish you had stayed longer.
